            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               The Philadelphia Museum of Art, established in 1876 as part of the city’s Centennial Exposition, lies in the Fairmount neighborhood 
               and stands as a bookend to the city’s grand Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a major thoroughfare modeled after Paris’ Champs Élysées. 
               Comprised of three buildings—the Rodin Museum, which sits on a different part of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and the Perelman Building, 
               which is just north of the main building, and the central museum itself—it holds over 240,000 artifacts, objects, and works of art, 
               including everything from sculpture and paintings to armor, decorative arts, and entire rooms meant to evoke other times, civilizations,
                and parts of the world. With its large space and high visitor count, the museum is among the largest and most visited museums on Earth.

            <h2> Liberty Bell</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               The Liberty Bell, previously called the State House Bell or Old State House Bell, is an iconic symbol of American independence 
               located in Philadelphia. Originally placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House (now renamed Independence Hall), 
               the bell today is located across the street in the Liberty Bell Center in Independence National Historical Park.               
            </p>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               Weighing 2,080 pounds, the Liberty Bell originally rang in the tower of Independence Hall (then known as Pennsylvania State House) in 1753.
               Since 2003, the Liberty Bell has been on display in a building in front of Independence Hall, The Liberty Bell Center.

               Built of brick, white marble, and limestone, Philadelphia City Hall is the world's largest free-standing masonry building 
               and was the world's tallest habitable building upon its completion in 1894. In 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark, 
               and in 2006, was also named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
